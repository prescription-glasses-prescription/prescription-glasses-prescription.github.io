<h3>My $372 Scratched Glasses Nightmare: 2 Days of Customer Service Hell! 😤</h3>
<p></br>
Let me share a truly terrible online shopping experience, hoping it serves as a cautionary tale. I shelled out $372 for glasses that arrived scratched. What followed was a nightmare of trying to fix it. I tried for two days just to talk to a human, with no luck. The bot kept sending return labels to an email I never received, and even after finally connecting with someone, they sent the wrong information for the return! The issue still isn't resolved, and I'm left feeling utterly frustrated. I felt compelled to leave this review and share my conversation with customer service because this level of ineptitude and lack of support is unacceptable.</p>
<p>Customer: "I've been trying for two days, two full days, to talk to someone! Your bot is useless, it keeps sending return labels to an email address I don't even use for this account, and I spent $372 on scratched glasses!"
CS Rep: "I am so sorry to hear about the scratched glasses and the extreme difficulty you've experienced reaching us and getting the correct return information. That sounds incredibly frustrating, and I truly apologize for the inconvenience and delay. Can you please confirm the order number and the email address you'd like the return label sent to?"
Customer: "The order number is [Order Number], and the correct email is [Correct Email]. And frankly, I’m furious. This issue still isn’t resolved, and I’m out $372 for glasses I can't even wear."
CS Rep: "Thank you for providing that. I understand your anger completely. I'm looking at your order now. I will immediately re-send the return label to the correct email address you just provided. Once we receive the scratched pair back, we can process a full refund or send a replacement, whichever you prefer."
Customer: "Just make sure it's the correct information this time, please. I'm beyond frustrated. This whole process has been a mess."
CS Rep: "Absolutely. I will personally ensure the correct return label is sent to the right email address right now, and I'll confirm its dispatch with you. I also want to offer a discount on a future purchase as a further apology for this terrible experience. Is there anything else I can assist with today regarding this return?"</p>
<p>The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

My last online glasses purchase was a total nightmare 😤. I shelled out $372 for scratched glasses, and trying to get a resolution was pure agony. I spent two full days trying to talk to a human, but the bot just kept sending return labels to an email I never received! Even when I finally connected with someone, they sent the wrong return information. The issue was never resolved, and I was left feeling utterly frustrated and out of pocket 😭. I swore I’d never buy glasses online again.</p>
<p>But after that terrible experience, I still needed new glasses. I decided to give online shopping one last try, but with a different approach 🤔. I searched specifically for companies known for reliable service and quality, hoping to find a contrast to my previous ordeal. That's when I stumbled upon cinily.net.</p>
<p>I read a review that simply said, "Ordering and delivery were efficient." This simple statement gave me a glimmer of hope. My experience with cinily.net has been exactly that, and so much more! From the moment I started browsing for <a href="https://www.cinily.net/collections/eyes-frame?page=153">prescription glasses</a>, the website was incredibly user-friendly and intuitive. The product quality is fantastic, far surpassing my expectations, especially for the price point. Customer service, when I had a small question, was prompt, clear, and genuinely helpful – a stark contrast to my previous woes! The entire process was smooth and professional ✨, making me genuinely happy with my new pair. I'm so relieved to have found a trustworthy place for my eyewear needs. Highly recommend! 😃</p>
