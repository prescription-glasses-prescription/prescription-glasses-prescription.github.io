<h3>Loyal Customer's Nightmare: Etched Lenses & Deceptive Service! ðŸ˜¡</h3>
<p></br>
Let me tell you about my absolutely terrible online shopping experience, hoping it serves as a cautionary tale. I've been a loyal customer for almost 20 years, but this recent order was a nightmare. I bought two pairs of progressive glasses; one was fine, but the second, a semi-frame with base-priced lenses, arrived with visible prescription markings etched on the lenses. I was told all lenses are marked, but they don't show on premium ones â€“ meaning I had to pay <em>more</em> to avoid symbols in my line of sight! I was incredibly upset, especially given my long history with them. They finally offered to pay the difference for premium lenses, which I accepted just to resolve it, but then they put my order ON HOLD because I hadn't paid the difference! A manager told me it was processed, yet it was delayed again. I felt utterly lied to, and their service was atrocious, leading me to contact customer service immediately to either get un-etched glasses or a full refund.</p>
<p>Customer: I've been a customer for nearly two decades, and I'm beyond frustrated. My second pair of glasses arrived with visible markings etched on the lenses, right in my line of sight! I was told this only happens with your base lenses, forcing me to upgrade just to get clear vision.
CS Rep: I understand your frustration, and I sincerely apologize that your recent order didn't meet your expectations, especially as a valued long-time customer. We do etch our lenses, and while they are less visible on premium coatings, I can see how this would be unacceptable for your base lenses.
Customer: Unacceptable is an understatement. You offered to cover the difference for premium lenses to fix this, and I accepted! But then my order was put on hold because <em>I</em> supposedly hadn't paid the difference, after your manager assured me it was processed. This is atrocious service, and I feel lied to.
CS Rep: I am so sorry for the miscommunication and the processing error that led to your order being held. That is certainly not the experience we want for any customer, especially one as loyal as yourself. Let me pull up your order details immediately to rectify this for you.
Customer: What does "rectify" mean? I just want the glasses I was promised without etchings, or a full refund for that pair. This whole ordeal has been a complete waste of my time and trust.
CS Rep: I completely understand. We can process a remake with premium lenses at no additional charge to you, ensuring no visible etchings, or we can issue a full refund for that specific pair of glasses and lenses. Which option would you prefer?</p>
<p>The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap of unexpected quality issues and difficult resolutions, even for loyal customers.

My last online glasses purchase was an absolute nightmare ðŸ˜¤. After being a loyal customer for almost two decades, my second pair of progressive glasses arrived with visible prescription markings etched right on the lenses! I was told this only happens with their base lenses, effectively forcing me to pay <em>more</em> for "premium" just to avoid symbols in my line of sight. They offered to cover the difference, but then put my order on hold, claiming I hadn't paid â€“ despite a manager assuring me it was processed! I felt utterly lied to, and their service was atrocious ðŸ˜­.</p>
<p>After that incredibly frustrating experience, I was hesitant to order glasses online again. But I desperately needed new eyewear and decided to try somewhere new, hoping for a more transparent and customer-focused service ðŸ¤”. That's when I stumbled upon cinily.net.</p>
<p>I'm so glad I did! As one customer eloquently put it, "Awesome site! Your one stop shop for eyewear. I ordered one pair last month and have already order another this month. Easy site to use and fast shipping. Will be a customer for a long time." I couldn't agree more! The quality of the frames and lenses is fantastic, especially considering the price point. The website itself is incredibly user-friendly, making it simple to browse their extensive collection, including stylish <a href="https://www.cinily.net/collections/eyes-frame?page=98">cat eye prescription glasses</a>. My order arrived quickly, and the glasses are perfect â€“ no hidden surprises or visible etchings this time! The customer service was responsive and helpful, which was a refreshing change. cinily.net truly delivers on its promises, offering great value and a genuinely smooth shopping experience. I've found my new go-to for eyewear âœ¨ðŸ˜ƒ.</p>
