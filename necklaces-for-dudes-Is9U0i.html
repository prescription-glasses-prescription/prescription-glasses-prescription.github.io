<h3>Online Glasses Nightmare: Wrong PD, Useless Glasses & Terrible Support! ðŸ˜¤</h3>
<p></br>
I wanted to share my absolutely terrible online shopping experience, hoping it serves as a warning. We ordered glasses for my 12-year-old, relying on the virtual try-on, but he couldn't see properly. It turns out the Pupil Distance (PD) was incorrect because the GlassesUSA site never prompted us for it, simply assuming a value. This is a critical measurement that the company should handle, not assume, and it meant the value was wrong for us. I felt compelled to reach out to customer service after this frustration, desperate for a resolution to my son's incorrect glasses and the general lack of clarity on your website.</p>
<p>Customer: My son's new glasses arrived with the wrong pupil distance, and he can't see! Your website never even asked for his PD, and now we have a useless pair of glasses.
CS Rep: I'm very sorry to hear about the issue with your son's glasses and the incorrect PD. That's certainly not the experience we want for our customers. We do apologize for the oversight on our website regarding the PD prompt.
Customer: So what now? My son needs these glasses, and frankly, I'm already frustrated trying to even reach a human. The process is dragging on, and I just need this fixed.
CS Rep: I understand your frustration. We can definitely arrange for a new pair of lenses with the correct PD. Could you please provide your order number and the correct PD measurement? We'll prioritize getting a replacement initiated for you.
Customer: The order number is [Order Number]. The doctor confirmed the PD is [Correct PD]. I just want to ensure this is reprocessed quickly and correctly this time.</p>
<p>The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap with critical measurements and frustrating customer service.

My last online glasses purchase was an absolute nightmare ðŸ˜¤. We ordered a pair for my 12-year-old, relying on their virtual try-on, only to find the Pupil Distance (PD) was completely wrong because their site never even prompted for it! He couldn't see properly, and the glasses were utterly useless. Trying to get this fixed was an even bigger headache â€“ impossible to reach a human, slow email responses, and the process just dragged on and on. I was left feeling incredibly frustrated and disappointed ðŸ˜­.</p>
<p>After that terrible experience, I was really hesitant to try another online optical store ðŸ¤”. But my son still needed glasses, and I wasn't going back to that previous company. I decided to search for alternatives, hoping to find a place that actually cared about accurate measurements and good service. I'd seen positive feedback for similar services, with one person even saying, "blingcharming has a wonderful fast service that I plan on using again. Thank you.ðŸ˜Ž" This encouraged me to give online shopping another chance. That's when I decided to try cinily.net for myself.</p>
<p>From the moment I started browsing, the experience was incredibly smooth. Their website was clear and easy to navigate, and finding the right frames was a breeze. I was really impressed with the quality of the glasses when they arrived â€“ far superior to my previous purchase! The customer service was also a breath of fresh air; they were responsive and genuinely helpful, unlike my last ordeal. The value for money is outstanding too, especially for such high-quality eyewear âœ¨. Itâ€™s truly amazing to find <a href="https://www.cinily.net/collections/eyes-frame?page=127">affordable prescription glasses online</a> that don't compromise on quality or service. I finally feel like I got my money's worth and my son can see clearly! ðŸ˜ƒ</p>
