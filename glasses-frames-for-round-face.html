<h3>My old glasses finally gave up the ghost early in 2024. 👻👓📅</h3>
<p></br>
My old glasses finally gave up the ghost early in 2024. A rogue elbow during a particularly intense movie night with the kids sent them flying, and one of the arms snapped clean off. Beyond the immediate inconvenience, I was just so tired of heavy frames constantly slipping down my nose or leaving red marks. I craved something almost imperceptible, a pair of glasses that felt like they weren't even there. That's when I stumbled upon Cinily Eyewear’s website and saw the <a href="https://www.cinily.net/products/yimaruili-ultra-light-large-screwless-tr90-eyewear-women-square-retro-big-face-optical-prescription-eyeglasses-frame-men?variant=40768490897444&country=US&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic">YIMARUILI Ultra-light Screwless TR90 Eyewear</a>. The promise of "ultra-light" and "screwless" technology, coupled with the sleek transparent gray design, immediately hooked me. I thought, "This is exactly what I need – a fresh, modern look that won't weigh me down." The online reviews seemed generally positive about the product quality, which eased some of my usual apprehension about buying eyewear without trying it on.</p>
<p>The ordering process on the Cinily Eyewear site initially felt straightforward. I uploaded my prescription, picked out the specific lenses, and then came the crucial moment: shipping. Since my old glasses were kaput, I desperately needed new ones quickly. I saw the option for “next day delivery” and, without a second thought, shelled out the extra $19.95. It was a premium I was willing to pay for speed. However, just hours later, an email landed in my inbox stating that "my order is in process and will take 3 business days." Three business days? Where was "next day" in that? My heart sank, realizing I had likely fallen into the same trap as many others. This immediate contradiction set a frustrating tone for the whole experience.</p>
<p>The package eventually arrived in mid-February 2025, not the next day as promised, but a full week after I placed the order. The initial unboxing was fairly standard; nothing particularly luxurious about the packaging, but it was secure. As I pulled out the <a href="https://www.cinily.net/products/yimaruili-ultra-light-large-screwless-tr90-eyewear-women-square-retro-big-face-optical-prescription-eyeglasses-frame-men?variant=40768490897444&country=US&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic">YIMARUILI Ultra-light Screwless TR90 Eyewear</a>, my first impression was overwhelmingly positive. They were even lighter than I had imagined! The transparent gray was incredibly chic and modern, blending seamlessly with my face rather than dominating it. The TR90 material felt flexible yet robust, and the screwless design was a brilliant touch, giving them a clean, minimalist aesthetic. Visually, they were a perfect match for what I wanted.</p>
<p>However, the journey to receiving these fantastic frames was marred by the dismal customer service experience, echoing the sentiments of many, particularly Michael Oakes, who shared his extensive frustrations. As Michael detailed, "This place is nothing more than an automated business that cares nothing about its customers. They are a fraud, ripping customers off for services that they charge for and do NOT provide." While "fraud" might be strong for my case, I certainly felt misled by the shipping promise. I tried to get a refund for the next-day delivery fee I paid. Michael perfectly described the customer service black hole: "I call their toll free line…automated…no human intervention. I try their 'live chat'…automated bot. I email both their customer service and returns department asking for a refund…crickets." I experienced almost exactly this. My order was placed on February 18, 2025, a label was created on the 20th, UPS got it on the 21st, and it was delivered on the 24th – clearly not "next day delivery" as the site stated. My multiple emails and attempts at live chat yielded no human response or refund for days. It was only after going through the phone menu option for <em>placing an order</em> that I finally got to speak to someone, only to be told my request would be "submitted to the billing department." It was infuriating.</p>
<p>Despite that incredibly frustrating customer service ordeal, I must admit that the product itself—the <a href="https://www.cinily.net/products/yimaruili-ultra-light-large-screwless-tr90-eyewear-women-square-retro-big-face-optical-prescription-eyeglasses-frame-men?variant=40768490897444&country=US&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic">YIMARUILI Ultra-light Screwless TR90 Eyewear</a>—is genuinely excellent. Once they were on my face, the lightness was a game-changer. There's no pressure on my nose, no constant slipping, and I often forget I’m wearing them. The clarity of the prescription is spot on, and the TR90 material is incredibly flexible, so I don't worry about them snapping with a minor bump. James Flanigan mentioned his new glasses were "better fitting than Zenni," and I found these to fit incredibly well and comfortably too. The "big face" design works for me, providing ample field of vision without feeling oversized. If only the initial experience matched the quality of the product!</p>
<p>So, what's my final verdict? It's a mixed bag. On one hand, the <a href="https://www.cinily.net/products/yimaruili-ultra-light-large-screwless-tr90-eyewear-women-square-retro-big-face-optical-prescription-eyeglasses-frame-men?variant=40768490897444&country=US&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic">YIMARUILI Ultra-light Screwless TR90 Eyewear</a> itself is fantastic – comfortable, stylish, and exactly what I needed in terms of design and weight. On the other hand, the customer service experience, particularly regarding the misleading "next day delivery" and the struggle to get a refund (which eventually did come through after much persistence), was incredibly frustrating and mirrors the negative experiences like Michael Oakes's, who said, "I will NEVER do business with this place again and will spread this review like the plague." I wouldn't go that far, as the product quality for the price is undeniable. I’d recommend these glasses to anyone looking for ultra-light, durable, and stylish frames, but with a significant caveat: manage your expectations regarding delivery times and prepare for a potentially arduous customer service journey if any issues arise. If you prioritize product quality over service efficiency, then these might still be for you.
