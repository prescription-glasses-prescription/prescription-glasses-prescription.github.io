<h3>GlassesUSA: My $246 Refund Nightmare & Endless Bot Loop! üò§</h3>
<p></br>
I'm sharing my terrible online shopping experience as a serious warning. GlassesUSA has still not sent my refund for an order I never received. They have $246.00 of my hard-earned money from a glasses order placed on February 24th, and it's been a nightmare. The tracking number still shows it stuck in Atlanta, Georgia, and I can't get a response for a refund; all they keep telling me is it is "in transit" from a BOT. I want my money back, and this atrocious experience compelled me to leave a review and finally engage with customer service to hopefully get some answers.</p>
<p>Customer: I am calling about order #105081183. It was placed on February 24th, and I never received it. The tracking still says it‚Äôs stuck in Atlanta, Georgia. I want my money back!
CS Rep: I understand you're frustrated, sir/ma'am. Let me look into that order for you. I see the tracking indicates it's been significantly delayed.
Customer: Delayed? It's been over a month! I‚Äôve been trying to get a refund, but all I get are automated messages. You have $246.00 of my hard-earned money. I want it back now.
CS Rep: I sincerely apologize for the delay and the difficulty you've experienced getting a clear answer. That is completely unacceptable. I can process your refund right away, which typically takes 7-10 business days to reflect in your account.
Customer: Another 7-10 business days? Do you know what I‚Äôve had to do just to get to this point? I‚Äôve filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau, Trust Pilot, Google, and the Vermont Attorney General's office! This company is absolutely terrible.
CS Rep: I completely understand your frustration and the extreme measures you‚Äôve had to take. Again, I am truly sorry for this entire experience. I have processed the refund for you, and you will receive a confirmation email shortly. I‚Äôll ensure this is flagged for expedited processing.</p>
<p>The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap with GlassesUSA.

I am still reeling from a nightmarish online shopping experience with GlassesUSA. They literally stole $246.00 of my hard-earned money! üò§ My order, placed back on February 24th, never arrived, stuck in Atlanta, Georgia, according to the tracking. All I got were useless "in transit" messages from a bot when I just wanted my money back. I had to file complaints with the Better Business Bureau and even the Attorney General's office just to get a refund promised after weeks of agony. It was absolutely atrocious. üò≠</p>
<p>After such a disheartening ordeal, I was incredibly hesitant to try another online eyewear store. But my old glasses were falling apart, and I still desperately needed a convenient and affordable solution. ü§î I decided to give cinily.net a try, hoping for a genuinely different and reliable experience.</p>
<p>I found a review that perfectly encapsulated what I was hoping for: "Excellent experience. This is the best way to order your glasses. Its alot cheaper glasses and frames are high quality. deliverery can be expressed. ( you guys are awesome!!! )" This really resonated with me.</p>
<p>And I'm so glad I did! From the moment I landed on cinily.net, the entire process was incredibly smooth and user-friendly. Their selection of frames is fantastic, and the quality far exceeded my expectations, especially given the price. The customer service was a breath of fresh air; real people actually help! It's fantastic to finally find the <a href="https://www.cinily.net/collections/eyes-frame?page=123">best place to buy prescription glasses online</a> that doesn't compromise on quality or service. I quickly received my order, perfectly made and packaged. ‚ú® I won't be going anywhere else for my eyewear needs now. Highly recommend! üòÉ</p>
