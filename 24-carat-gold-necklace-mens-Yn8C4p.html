<h3>Price Jump & Zero Support: My Shady Online Glasses Nightmare! ðŸ˜¡</h3>
<p></br>
I'm here to share a truly terrible online shopping experience, hoping it serves as a warning. I shopped for glasses today and found a Pentax ZT100 priced at $40.60. But as I built my order, the price jumped to $58.00 right before my eyes! It was so shady; they literally raised the price as I was about to screenshot it! I felt compelled to leave a review and engage with customer service because this kind of dishonest pricing and lack of support is simply unacceptable. There's no CS phone number, the botchat is useless, and even a live person just gave me the runaround, blaming lens and frame color despite my proof. These guys are shady, and I expect honest pricing and good service from a business.</p>
<p>Customer: I'm extremely frustrated. I was trying to buy Pentax ZT100 glasses, priced at $40.60, but when I went to checkout, the price suddenly jumped to $58.00! This is completely shady.
CS Rep: I truly apologize for that experience. A sudden price change at checkout is certainly not ideal. Can you provide any details of your cart or when this occurred so I can investigate?
Customer: It happened today, just as I was about to complete the order. I even spoke to someone before, and they gave me the runaround, blaming it on lens choices and frame color, even though I had proof it was the base price.
CS Rep: I understand you've already had a frustrating interaction, and I'm very sorry for that. I'm checking the system now. The current list price for the Pentax ZT100 is indeed $58.00. I can't directly adjust past pricing, but I'd like to offer you a special discount code for your purchase today to reflect the $40.60 price you initially saw as an apology for the confusion.
Customer: So, you're saying I should just accept the higher price, and this is your solution? I just want the advertised price.
CS Rep: My apologies if that wasn't clear. No, I am offering you a discount code that would bring the price down to the $40.60 you saw. I want to ensure you get the price you expected for the frame. Would you like me to generate that for you?</p>
<p>The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap of dishonest pricing and poor customer service.

My last online glasses shopping experience was a complete nightmare! ðŸ˜¤ I was trying to buy Pentax ZT100 glasses advertised at $40.60, but right before my eyes, the price magically jumped to $58.00 at checkout! It felt incredibly shady, and their customer service was non-existent â€“ useless botchat, no phone number, and a live person who just gave me the runaround, blaming lens and frame choices despite my proof. I ended up with nothing but frustration and disappointment. ðŸ˜­</p>
<p>After that terrible ordeal, I was incredibly hesitant to try buying glasses online again. But I desperately needed a new pair, and I kept seeing positive reviews for cinily.net, so I decided to give them a chance, hoping for a completely different outcome. ðŸ¤”</p>

<p>My experience with cinily.net has been fantastic. Their website is easy to navigate, and the pricing is straightforward and honest â€“ no nasty surprises at checkout! âœ¨ The quality of my Vintage Cat Eye frames is superb, and the lenses are perfectly fitted. Finding <a href="https://www.cinily.net/collections/eyes-frame?page=78">cheap prescription glasses</a> that don't compromise on quality is a huge win. The entire process, from selection to delivery, was smooth and efficient. I'm truly impressed and relieved to finally have a positive online shopping experience for my eyewear! ðŸ˜ƒ</p>
