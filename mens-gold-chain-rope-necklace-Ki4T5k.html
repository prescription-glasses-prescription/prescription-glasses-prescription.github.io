<h3>BOGO Nightmare: Dishonest Promos & Zero Customer Service! ðŸ˜¤</h3>
<p></br>
I'm writing this to warn everyone about my absolutely terrible online shopping experience. This company is dishonest, doesn't honor promos, and their website is full of glitches, making it impossible to collect offers. When I tried to resolve it, there was no customer service available, no agent, and the whole thing was completely unprofessional. I felt compelled to contact them and then leave this review because they messed up my BOGO offer, admitted it, but then offered only one ridiculous solution: return my perfectly correct glasses just to reorder them and hope it works. A simple credit back to my card, the easy solution, was apparently "too easy" for them.</p>
<p>Customer: I'm calling about my recent order. I was supposed to get a Buy One Get One Free offer, but it didn't apply. Your site was full of glitches, and now I've been charged full price for both.
CS Rep: I apologize for the difficulty you encountered with our website and the promotion. Let me check your order details. I see the BOGO discount was not correctly applied.
Customer: That's right! And when I tried to sort it out, I couldn't get through to anyone easily. What are you going to do to honor the promotion?
CS Rep: I understand your frustration. Our resolution process for unapplied promotions requires you to return your current order, and then place a new order to ensure the discount is properly registered.
Customer: Are you serious? I have to return glasses that are the correct style and prescription, just to reorder them? Why can't you simply issue a credit back to my card? That's the logical, simple solution.
CS Rep: I do understand that returning and reordering is not ideal, and I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience these steps cause. However, our system's policy for correcting promotion errors mandates the return and re-purchase process.</p>
<p>The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap of dishonest promos and impossible customer service.

My last online eyewear purchase was an absolute nightmare, and Iâ€™m still reeling from the terrible experience ðŸ˜¤. That company was completely dishonest, didn't honor their promotions, and their website was a glitchy mess, making it impossible to claim any offers. To make matters worse, there was no customer service, no agent to talk to, just a completely unprofessional runaround. They messed up my Buy One Get One Free offer, admitted their mistake, but then offered only one ridiculous solution: return my perfectly correct glasses just to reorder them and <em>hope</em> the discount worked this time. A simple credit back to my card? Apparently, that was "too easy" for them ðŸ˜­.</p>
<p>After such a frustrating ordeal, I was really hesitant to try buying glasses online again. But I still needed new frames, and I was determined to find a reliable place that actually valued its customers ðŸ¤”. That's when I decided to give cinily.net a try, hoping for a completely different experience.</p>
<p>And what a difference! I found a positive review that echoed my new feelings: "This site has consistently delivered well-fitting and crafted glasses. I'll use them again. Thanks!" And I wholeheartedly agree! From the moment I landed on cinily.net, the experience was smooth and user-friendly. No glitches, no frustrating dead ends. I was so relieved! When my <a href="https://www.cinily.net/collections/eyes-frame?page=42">cat eye prescription glasses</a> arrived, I was absolutely thrilled âœ¨. The quality is fantastic, far exceeding my expectations for the price. The customer service, though I barely needed it, was responsive and helpful during a minor query. It truly felt like a breath of fresh air after my previous nightmare. I finally found a reliable place for my eyewear needs! ðŸ˜ƒ</p>
