<p></br>
As a blogger always staring at screens, I knew I needed something with blue light blocking. My old glasses were just‚Ä¶ boring. I wanted something with a bit more personality, something that screamed 'retro chic' but also protected my eyes from endless hours of typing. The search began, and like many others, I was on the hunt for a good deal. I‚Äôd seen ads for Cinily Eyewear pop up, promising stylish frames at reasonable prices, which immediately caught my eye. My eyes often felt strained by the end of 2024, a common complaint I later found echoed by others. I was hoping these <a href="https://www.cinily.net/products/punk-anti-blue-light-blocking-round-glasses-frame-women-retro-eyeglasses-for-ladies-optical-frame-prescription?variant=40768182321188&country=US&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic">Retro Round Anti-Blue Light Glasses</a> could be my savior, offering both a fashionable upgrade and much-needed eye protection from my digital life. The sheer variety of frames available online was overwhelming in the best way, making me feel confident I could find something that truly reflected my style while addressing my practical needs.</p>
<p>My previous experiences with eyewear purchases often involved trekking to brick-and-mortar stores, dealing with pushy salespeople, and eye-watering prices. So, the idea of ordering online from Cinily Eyewear was incredibly appealing. I scrolled through countless frames, using their virtual try-on feature ‚Äì a truly helpful tool, as Joanna Cosmo pointed out, ‚ÄúThe virtual try on is helpful.‚Äù I compared prices, looked at different styles, and finally settled on the <a href="https://www.cinily.net/products/punk-anti-blue-light-blocking-round-glasses-frame-women-retro-eyeglasses-for-ladies-optical-frame-prescription?variant=40768182321188&country=US&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic">Retro Round Anti-Blue Light Glasses</a>, hoping they would deliver on both style and function. The pricing seemed excellent, especially when compared to traditional retail. However, my journey wasn't entirely smooth sailing. I was tempted by the express shipping, given my old glasses were on their last legs. But I remembered seeing comments like Braden Bell's, who said, ‚ÄúOrdered glasses March 30th, paid for express shipping 3-5 because my old glasses broke. Day 5 roles around still in production, day 10 still in production‚Ä¶ Stop giving terrible companies your money let them die out because someone doesnt give a crap about their customers.‚Äù This, coupled with Denise LeFrancois's blunt feedback: ‚ÄúFirstly, be aware that the company replies to every negative review with the same answer‚Ä¶.\"there was an issue with the product so it had to be remade\"! Garbage answer. I was ripped off for express shipping on several pairs and would never do that again!\nLook, I tried in vain to leave a review on the website, where my glasses are listed, but that doesn't work.\nSo after about a 10 minute search I finally am able to leave a review! The customer service is the among the worst I have ever experienced.\n\nJust so you know, don't bother paying for the faster shipping because you still will have to wait a few weeks to get your glasses. So save yourself that money as it will only get your glasses to you in about 2 days sooner. Not worth that money,‚Äù convinced me to save my money and opt for standard shipping. Waiting was tough, as Joanna Cosmo also mentioned, ‚ÄúThe only thing was it took a little over a week to receive which is not bad but not that quick.‚Äù This anticipation was certainly a test of patience, and dealing with Cinily Eyewear's customer service, as Denise put it, was indeed ‚Äúthe among the worst I have ever experienced.‚Äù Attempts to reach them via chat or email, as she noted, were often frustrating: ‚ÄúDon't expect to hear from anyone if you reach out by email. Don't expect to really get help with the \"chat\", even though you will be transferred to \"live agent\", or so they say. I am not sold on that as truth.‚Äù It truly felt like I was navigating a labyrinth without a guide.</p>
<p>When the package finally arrived in late 2024, my anticipation was at an all-time high. It came in what Joanna Cosmo described as a ‚Äúcute reusable box and cloth pouch,‚Äù which was a nice touch, though she correctly noted, ‚Äúyou have to get a case separately.‚Äù The frames themselves, the <a href="https://www.cinily.net/products/punk-anti-blue-light-blocking-round-glasses-frame-women-retro-eyeglasses-for-ladies-optical-frame-prescription?variant=40768182321188&country=US&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic">Retro Round Anti-Blue Light Glasses</a>, were exactly as pictured online. The gray finish was sleek, and the round shape perfectly captured that vintage vibe I was going for. They felt surprisingly sturdy in hand, defying some of the initial worries I might have had about online optical purchases. Virginia Byrom's simple ‚ÄúBeautiful!!!‚Äù review resonated with my initial impression ‚Äì they truly were aesthetically pleasing right out of the box. The weight felt just right, not too heavy to cause discomfort, but substantial enough to feel durable. I immediately tried them on, and they fit snugly, without slipping or pinching, which was a huge relief given the uncertainty of ordering glasses without an in-person fitting.</p>
<p>The real test, of course, was putting them on. The blue light blocking was immediately noticeable, casting a subtle warm tint that made my computer screen feel much less harsh. My eyes, which usually feel fatigued by midday, now felt considerably more relaxed, even after a full day of work. This really delivered on my primary need. As Charles McGee happily shared, ‚ÄúGreat glasses, I‚Äôm very happy with my purchase,‚Äù and I certainly echoed that sentiment regarding the lens quality. Denise LeFrancois, despite her struggles with customer service, also had high praise for the lenses: ‚ÄúI am happy to report that they sell quality frames and the lenses are superior to what I have gotten at Lens Crafters! And that is saying a lot! I did pay for the water and fingerprint protection coating and it has proven to be a wise choice!‚Äù I also opted for that coating, and I can confirm it‚Äôs fantastic ‚Äì smudges wipe off easily, and raindrops bead right off, maintaining clarity. However, the experience wasn't completely without its bumps. While my single vision prescription was perfect, I did think about those with more complex needs. Denise, for instance, specifically noted, ‚ÄúThey are the only ones to make a Bifocal lens..Not progressive, they also make those, but an actual LINED BIFOCAL, which is my preference. The height of the bifocal is a tad low for me, so still getting used to that. So, if you do order a bifocal, have your eye doctor give the correct height that you can pass on to Glasses USA‚Ä¶..they have a standard height which is NOT for everyone. The true height of the bifocal is measured on a 1:1 and goes by the individual eyes.‚Äù This highlights the importance of precise measurements for certain prescriptions, and while it wasn't my issue, it‚Äôs a vital consideration for anyone with specific lens requirements.</p>
<p>Another point of concern, which I personally didn't encounter but saw echoed in other reviews, involved prescription accuracy and general customer service responsiveness once an issue arises. Kevin Carroll's experience was particularly troubling: ‚ÄúSent me the wrong prescription safety glasses, causing dizziness and nausea. It‚Äôs been Impossible to get ahold of a live person to actually help get this resolved. Multiple chat sessions, phone calls and emails and still can‚Äôt in touch with anyone. I recommend buying from another company even if it‚Äôs a few more dollars.‚Äù Gary Warren had a similar nightmare: ‚ÄúSpent $372 on SCRATCHED glasses and tried to start a return/exchange. Never received the return label and the ‚Äúbot‚Äù just continues to send it to my email, that I never received!‚Äù While my glasses were perfectly fine, these comments underscore a significant area for Cinily Eyewear to improve. The returns policy itself, as Denise noted, is quite generous: ‚ÄúFinally, I also read in other review that they only accept ONE glass for return. THIS IS NOT TRUE. I have sent back 3 pairs so far and may not be done until I find the perfect pair for my face. THEY DO REFUND YOUR MONEY ON ALL GLASSES SENT IN FOR RETURN! Just be reasonable and return them within 14 days. Sadly, I have another pair of everyday wear coming that may fit my face better. But then I will be stuck with the pair I am currently wearing because this current pair is now 3 days past the 14 day window. Should I try to ask for help with this from the company? Yes, I should. Will I? No way will I because they have no one to help you!! I actually just changed the 3 star to a 2 star because of the piss poor customer service. Laughable.‚Äù This full account from Denise perfectly encapsulates the frustration: what good is a policy if you can't reach anyone to process it? This lack of accessible, human support is a real pain point that mars an otherwise good product.</p>
<p>Overall, my experience with the <a href="https://www.cinily.net/products/punk-anti-blue-light-blocking-round-glasses-frame-women-retro-eyeglasses-for-ladies-optical-frame-prescription?variant=40768182321188&country=US&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic">Retro Round Anti-Blue Light Glasses</a> from Cinily Eyewear has been a mixed bag, but leaning heavily towards satisfaction. For single vision lenses, as Joanna Cosmo summarized, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs much cheaper and for single vision prescriptions why pay more?‚Äù I couldn't agree more. The quality of the frames and lenses far exceeded my expectations, especially considering the price point. David Forster's concise ‚ÄúGood price and prompt delivery. Glasses work well‚Äù also captures the essence of a straightforward, positive experience many users have. I would absolutely recommend Cinily Eyewear for those with simpler prescriptions looking for stylish, affordable eyewear, provided you set your expectations for customer service interactions low and aren't in a desperate rush for delivery. If you have your pupillary distance (PD) handy, as Joanna mentioned, ‚Äúas long as you have the pupillary distance you‚Äôre all set,‚Äù you're good to go. The value for money is truly exceptional. However, Cinily Eyewear urgently needs to overhaul its customer support system. As Denise perfectly concluded, after her ordeal, ‚ÄúI would have given them a 5 star but the worst ever customer service brings it down to a 3 star. What a shame. They have such a great opportunity to sweep the market for online glasses but they failed and it's all due to NO CUSTOMER SERVICE!‚Äù This sentiment is a stark reminder that even a great product can be overshadowed by poor support. Fix that, Cinily, and you truly could be unstoppable.
