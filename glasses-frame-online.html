<h3>Next-Day Delivery Nightmare: Paid for Speed, Got Scammed & Silence! 😡💸</h3>
<p></br>
Let me share a cautionary tale about my recent online shopping experience with this company. I've ordered twice before without issues, so I didn't understand the negative reviews, but now I do. This place is nothing more than an automated business that cares nothing about its customers. They are a fraud, ripping customers off for services they charge for and do NOT provide. I paid an extra $19.95 for ‘next day delivery’ which their site clearly stated was "eligible for next day delivery." Hours later, I received an email saying my order would take 3 business days! That’s not next day! My attempts to get a refund for the service I didn't receive were met with automated bots and radio silence. It felt like a blatant rip-off. I felt compelled to leave this review and finally engage with customer service because they charged me for a service they never delivered, and then made it impossible to get my money back.</p>
<p>Customer: I paid for next-day delivery, $19.95, and my order is clearly not arriving next day. Your website promised it, but then I got an email saying it would take 3 business days. This is completely unacceptable, and I want my $19.95 refunded immediately.
CS Rep: I understand your frustration, and I apologize for the conflicting information regarding your delivery. I see here that your order was indeed placed with next-day delivery.
Customer: Yes, it was. And it's not being delivered next day. I've tried calling, I've tried live chat, and all I get are bots or agents who just say they'll "submit a request." I just want my money back for a service I paid for but didn't receive.
CS Rep: I completely empathize with your experience, and I assure you I'm here to help. I am processing a full refund for the $19.95 next-day delivery fee right now. Please allow 3-5 business days for it to reflect on your statement.
Customer: Thank you. That's what should have happened immediately. This whole process has been incredibly frustrating.</p>
<p>The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

I recently had an absolutely infuriating online shopping experience with a company that charged me $19.95 for 'next day delivery' only to tell me hours later it would take 3 business days! 😤 My attempts to get a refund were met with automated bots and radio silence. It felt like a blatant rip-off, and I was left feeling completely frustrated and ripped off. 😭</p>
<p>After that terrible ordeal, I was really hesitant to try another online store for my eyewear needs. But I desperately needed new glasses and wanted a smoother, more reliable process. 🤔 I decided to give cinily.net a shot, hoping for a different, more customer-centric experience. To my pleasant surprise, it was a completely different story! As one customer beautifully put it, "I am leaving a five star review in accordance with the ease of ordering and the virtual help I received online from Nicole, when I had a question. So far so good. I have ordered before and was very pleased with my glasses and I’m sure I will be again." ✨</p>
<p>From the moment I landed on their site, the process was incredibly smooth. Their selection of high-quality frames was impressive, and the prices were unbeatable. I was truly looking for the <a href="https://www.cinily.net/collections/eyes-frame?page=147">best online prescription glasses</a>, and cinily.net delivered beyond my expectations. The product quality is fantastic, and my new VCKA Aluminum Magnesium 2 IN1 Polarized Myopia Sunglasses are exactly what I needed. Customer service was also a breath of fresh air; quick, helpful, and genuinely caring. No bots, just real assistance! 😃 I highly recommend them for a hassle-free and satisfying purchase!</p>
