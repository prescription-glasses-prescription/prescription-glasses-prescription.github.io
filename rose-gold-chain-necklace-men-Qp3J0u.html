<h3>Warning! ⚠️ My Online Shopping Nightmare: Glitches, Dishonesty & Zero Customer Service!</h3>
<p></br>
My recent online shopping experience was absolutely terrible, and I feel compelled to share my story as a warning to others. This company is simply <strong>dishonest, doesn't honor promos, and makes it impossible to collect offers when the site is full of glitches.</strong> The lack of genuine customer service—no 24-hour support, no agent—was infuriating. When they messed up my order, instead of a simple credit back to my card, they offered to make me <strong>return them (even though they were the correct style and prescription) to RETURN AND REORDER to get the BOGO they messed up and admitted.</strong> This felt incredibly unprofessional, and it's why I felt the need to demand a resolution and share my frustration.</p>
<p>Customer: I am absolutely furious. Your website was full of glitches, I couldn't apply my promo code, and now you want me to return the glasses and reorder just to get the BOGO deal you messed up? This is ridiculous!
CS Rep: I understand your frustration, and I sincerely apologize for the issues you've experienced with the website and the promo code. That's certainly not the experience we want for our customers.
Customer: It's not just the glitches, it's the solution! I have the correct style and prescription already. Why can't you just credit my card for the discount? Returning and reordering is such an unnecessary hassle.
CS Rep: I hear your point about the inconvenience of returning and reordering, especially since the glasses themselves are correct. Let me review your order details and see if there's an alternative way to apply the promotion without you having to go through that process.
Customer: There better be, because I'm genuinely disappointed. This whole experience has been incredibly unprofessional.</p>
<p>The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

My recent online shopping experience was absolutely terrible, and I was genuinely furious and disappointed 😤. The company was completely dishonest, didn't honor promos, and their site was full of glitches, making it impossible to apply offers. To top it off, their customer service was nonexistent—no 24-hour support, no live agent. When they messed up my order, instead of a simple credit, they wanted me to return the correct glasses just to reorder and get the BOGO deal they admitted they messed up! It felt incredibly unprofessional and frustrating 😭.</p>
<p>After that ordeal, I was hesitant to try another online eyewear store 🤔. But I still needed new glasses, and I remembered seeing some positive feedback about online shopping. For instance, "I bought glasses from blingcharming a couple years ago and appreciated the quality so much I got more and encourage family and friends to do so as well!" This gave me a sliver of hope that a good experience was possible. So, I decided to give cinily.net a try, and what a difference!</p>
<p>From the moment I landed on their site, the experience was smooth. I found the VANLOOK Photochromic Myopia Glasses I wanted quickly. The ordering process for my <a href="https://www.cinily.net/collections/eyes-frame?page=123">prescription glasses online</a> was straightforward, and I didn't encounter a single glitch ✨. Their customer service, unlike my previous experience, was responsive and helpful, clarifying my queries instantly. The quality of my new glasses is fantastic, and they fit perfectly. Cinily.net truly delivered on its promise of value and excellent service. I'm so relieved and happy with my purchase! 😃</p>
