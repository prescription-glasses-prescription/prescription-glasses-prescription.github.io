<h3>My $372 Scratched Glasses & The Two-Day Return Nightmare: A Warning! 🚫😤</h3>
<p></br>
My recent online shopping experience was a complete nightmare, and I feel compelled to share my story as a warning to others. I spent $372 on SCRATCHED glasses and immediately tried to start a return/exchange. But the process has been a total mess. I've been trying for 2 days just to TALK TO A HUMAN to fix this issue, with no luck. The 'bot' just keeps sending the return label to an email I never received, and even after finally connecting with someone, they sent the WRONG INFORMATION FOR THE RETURN! It's sheer ineptitude, and I'm beyond frustrated. This whole ordeal has pushed me to the brink of giving up on this company, and I had to reach out to customer service to demand a resolution.</p>
<p>Customer: I am absolutely furious. I spent $372 on scratched glasses, and I've been trying for two days to get a return label that actually reaches me, or even just talk to a human! And when I finally did, you sent the wrong return information!
CS Rep: I sincerely apologize for the frustration and inconvenience you've experienced, especially with your scratched glasses and the difficulties in arranging a return. I understand this is unacceptable. Can you please provide your order number so I can look into this immediately?
Customer: My order number is [Customer Provides Order Number]. I need a correct return label sent to the right email address, and clear instructions this time. I haven't received anything useful yet, and I'm not buying from you again if this isn't fixed.
CS Rep: Thank you for the order number. I see the previous attempts and the issue with the incorrect email and return information. I am rectifying this now. I will generate a new return label and instructions and personally ensure they are sent to the correct email address you have on file, and I will confirm it with you here.
Customer: Just make sure it actually works this time. I've wasted too much time already.</p>
<p>The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap of terrible customer service and frustrating return processes.

My last online shopping experience was a complete nightmare, and I'm still fuming just thinking about it! 😤 I spent $372 on scratched glasses, and then endured two days of trying to talk to a human just to get a return label. The 'bot' was useless, sending emails I never received, and when I finally connected with someone, they sent the <em>wrong</em> return information! It was sheer ineptitude, and I was beyond frustrated. I almost gave up on online eyewear completely. 😭</p>
<p>But, needing a new pair of glasses, I decided to give it one more shot with cinily.net, hoping for a different outcome. 🤔 And oh, what a difference! I was so pleased with my experience here. It really echoes what I read from another happy customer: "Very pleased with my glasses. I only have single vision lenses, and with anti-glare the price was excellent. Other retail stores wanted twice the price and without anti-glare. I had a buy-one-get-one-free deal which was great. The virtual try on is helpful. The only thing was it took a little over a week to receive which is not bad but not that quick. I would definitely order glasses again online with this site, as long as you have the pupillary distance you’re all set. It’s much cheaper and for single vision prescriptions why pay more? They come in a cute reusable box and cloth pouch but you have to get a case separately." ✨</p>
<p>My experience was just as smooth and satisfying! The quality of the frames is fantastic, and the lenses are clear and perfect. Finding the perfect pair, like these amazing <a href="https://www.cinily.net/collections/eyes-frame?page=153">cat eye prescription glasses</a>, was so easy. The pricing is incredibly competitive, offering real value without compromising on quality or style. And the customer service? Responsive and genuinely helpful – a breath of fresh air after my previous ordeal. I'm absolutely delighted with my purchase and this company! 😃 I highly recommend cinily.net for anyone looking for a hassle-free and affordable eyewear solution.</p>
