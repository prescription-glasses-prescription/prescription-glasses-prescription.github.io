<h3>My Online Shopping Horror Story: Glitches, Fake Promos, and Infuriating Returns! ‚ö†Ô∏è</h3>
<p></br>
Let me share my absolutely terrible online shopping experience, hoping it serves as a warning to others. My encounter with this company has been nothing short of a nightmare. They are dishonest and don't honor promos, and their site is full of glitches, making it impossible to collect offers. When I tried to get help, there was no customer service available 24 hours, no agent to speak with ‚Äì just unprofessionalism. I will NOT return and I do NOT recommend them. The solutions they offered were infuriating: return them (even though they were the correct style and prescription) to RETURN AND REORDER to get the BOGO they messed up and admitted to. A simple credit back to my card? Nah, that's too easy for them. This whole ordeal left me no choice but to leave a review and try to get some answers from customer service.</p>
<p>Customer: I'm calling because I'm incredibly frustrated. Your website glitched, I couldn't apply a BOGO promotion, and now I'm told I have to return glasses that are already correct just to reorder them to get the deal? This is ridiculous.
CS Rep: I understand your frustration, and I sincerely apologize for the issues you've experienced with our website and the promotion. It sounds like a very inconvenient situation, especially having to reorder items that are already correct.
Customer: Inconvenient is an understatement. Why can't you just issue a credit for the difference? The glasses are fine, the prescription is right. This whole return and reorder process is an unnecessary waste of my time, and it feels like you're just making it hard.
CS Rep: I hear your concern about the return and reorder process, and I acknowledge that a credit would seem like a more straightforward solution. While our policy for rectifying missed BOGO promotions typically involves a reorder, I can definitely review your specific case. Could you please provide your order number so I can investigate if there are any other options available?
Customer: My order number is [Customer provides order number]. I just want this resolved simply. I've already wasted so much time with your glitches and now this. It's truly unprofessional.
CS Rep: Thank you for that. I'm actively looking into your order now. Please bear with me for a moment while I review the details and see what we can do to find the best possible resolution for you. I truly regret the trouble this has caused.</p>
<p>The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap of dishonest promotions and frustrating customer service.

I recently had an absolutely terrible online shopping experience. Their website was full of glitches, making it impossible to use promotions, and their customer service was non-existent and unhelpful. I was told to return perfectly good glasses just to reorder them to get a BOGO deal they messed up! It was a total nightmare and utterly unprofessional üò§üò≠. I vowed never to go back to online glasses shopping.</p>
<p>After that frustrating ordeal, I was really hesitant to try buying glasses online again ü§î. But I desperately needed new frames for my child, and after some research, I stumbled upon cinily.net, hoping for a smoother, more reliable experience. To my surprise, my experience was amazing! I read a review saying, "I had a great experience here with Wesley. He was extremely helpful and adjusted my glasses so now they‚Äôre perfect. They have great prices! I definitely recommend coming, i will be back for my sunglasses and my other prescription glasses!"</p>
<p>And I couldn't agree more! The cinily.net website was incredibly user-friendly, a stark contrast to my previous nightmare. Finding the perfect pair of children's frames for my son, the SECG 2023 TR90 Silicone Optical Kids Frames, was a breeze. The quality of the frames is fantastic ‚Äì durable and comfortable, perfect for an active child. Their customer service was prompt and genuinely helpful when I had a small query. They offer such a wide selection, especially for <a href="https://www.cinily.net/collections/eyes-frame?page=145">kids prescription glasses</a>, at really affordable prices without compromising on quality. The entire process, from selection to checkout, was seamless and efficient. It truly felt like they cared about my satisfaction. I'm so glad I gave online shopping another chance with cinily.net! ‚ú®</p>
