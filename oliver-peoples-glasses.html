<h3>My GlassesUSA Website Horror: 2.5 Hours Wasted & Unsaved Prescriptions! ðŸ˜¤</h3>
<p></br>
Let me tell you about my absolutely terrible online shopping experience. Iâ€™m sharing this as a cautionary tale for anyone considering using this site. The web site was so messed up it took me 2-1/2 hours to purchase two pairs of glasses. I was not able to type in my prescription and save it to continue my purchase! So now I will have to be sent an email to type in information that I already typed in on their silly web site. I truly felt compelled to leave a review and engage with customer service because frankly, the entire process was so very frustrating and certainly a waste of my time, and I'm not sure I will ever attempt to order glasses from Glasses USA ever again.</p>
<p>Customer: Hello, I'm calling because your website is an absolute nightmare. It took me two and a half hours trying to buy glasses, and I still couldn't even enter my prescription!</p>
<p>CS Rep: I am so incredibly sorry to hear you had such a frustrating experience on our website. That sounds incredibly inconvenient and I completely understand your annoyance. Can you tell me more about what happened when you tried to enter your prescription?</p>
<p>Customer: It just wouldn't save! Every time I tried, it would just glitch or not register, and now I'm being told I'll get an email to type it in again. I already typed it into your silly website! I'm so fed up with this process.</p>
<p>CS Rep: I truly apologize for that technical issue and the wasted time you experienced. It's unacceptable. Let me pull up your order for you right now. I can manually enter your prescription on my end and ensure your order gets processed correctly without any further hassle.</p>
<p>Customer: Can you really do that? Because honestly, after this, I'm not sure I'll ever attempt to order glasses from you again. This whole process was a total waste of my time.</p>
<p>CS Rep: Yes, absolutely. I can take your prescription details now and make sure everything is perfect for you. I truly hope we can resolve this efficiently today and regain your trust. I'll ensure your order goes through smoothly.</p>
<p>The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap of wasted time and frustration.

I recently had an absolutely terrible online shopping experience for glasses. The website was so messed up it took me two and a half hours just trying to purchase two pairs, and I still couldn't even enter my prescription! ðŸ˜¤ It kept glitching, and I was told I'd have to re-enter it via email â€“ after already typing it into their 'silly website.' I was utterly fed up and felt my time was completely wasted. I truly thought I'd never order glasses online again. ðŸ˜­</p>
<p>However, after that frustrating ordeal, I found myself still needing new glasses. I decided to give online shopping one last shot, hoping for a different outcome. That's when I stumbled upon cinily.net. I thought, maybe this time it would be different, maybe there's a better way to buy prescription glasses online. ðŸ¤”</p>
<p>To my pleasant surprise, my experience with cinily.net was exactly what I needed. It reminded me of a review I saw for 'blingcharming' (a former favorite), which said, 'Iâ€™ve been a customer for over four years now and I can truly say with each year the customer experience has gotten better. I donâ€™t even think about looking somewhere else.' I hoped for a similar feeling here.</p>
<p>And cinily.net delivered! From the moment I landed on their site, the process was incredibly smooth. The selection of <a href="https://www.cinily.net/collections/eyes-frame?page=78">prescription glasses online</a> was impressive, and navigating the site was a breeze â€“ no glitches, no wasted time! Entering my prescription was quick and easy. The quality of the frames I received is excellent, and the prices are so reasonable. Their customer service, though I barely needed it, seems top-notch. I'm genuinely thrilled with my new glasses and the entire experience. What a relief! âœ¨ðŸ˜ƒ I will definitely be coming back.</p>
