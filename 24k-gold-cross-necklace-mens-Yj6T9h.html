<h3>BOGO Nightmare: Glitches, Dishonesty, and Unprofessional Service 😤</h3>
<p></br>
I need to share my terrible online shopping experience, not just to vent, but as a cautionary tale. My attempt to use a simple "buy one get one" (BOGO) promo turned into an absolute nightmare. The site was full of glitches, making it impossible to collect the offer, and I found the company "Dishonest" for not honoring it. This entire ordeal felt incredibly "Unprofessional," especially when customer service suggested I "RETURN AND REORDER" my glasses, even though they were the correct style and prescription, just to get the promo they messed up. Why couldn't they just credit my card? That seemed too easy. I felt compelled to leave this review and engage with customer service to demand a proper resolution.</p>
<p>Customer: I'm calling because I had a terrible time trying to apply a BOGO promotion on your website. There were so many glitches, and it just wouldn't go through, even though the offer was clearly advertised.
CS Rep: I apologize for the difficulty you experienced with our website and the promotion, sir/ma'am. I understand that can be very frustrating. Can you please provide your order number so I can look into this for you?
Customer: My order number is [Customer provides order number]. The problem is, the glasses I received are correct, but the BOGO discount wasn't applied. When I contacted you previously, I was told I'd have to return them and reorder just to get the promo. That's ridiculous. Why can't you just credit the difference to my card?
CS Rep: I see the issue here. Our standard procedure for unapplied promotions sometimes involves a reorder, but I understand why that's inconvenient when the items themselves are correct. Please give me a moment to see if there's an alternative solution I can offer.
Customer: This whole situation feels dishonest. The promo wasn't honored due to your site's glitches, and forcing me to go through a return and reorder for something that's your mistake is completely unfair. I just want the credit for the BOGO offer that I was promised.</p>
<p>The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap of frustrating website glitches and unhelpful customer service policies.

I am still reeling from my last online glasses purchase; it was an absolute nightmare 😤. My attempt to use a simple "buy one get one" promo turned into a frustrating ordeal. The site was so full of glitches that it was impossible to collect the offer, making the company seem incredibly "Dishonest" for not honoring it. To top it all off, customer service was utterly "Unprofessional," suggesting I "RETURN AND REORDER" my glasses, even though they were the correct style and prescription, just to get the promo they messed up. Why couldn't they just credit my card? That felt too easy for them 😭.</p>
<p>After that terrible experience, I was really hesitant to try buying glasses online again 🤔. But I desperately needed new glasses, and I had heard some promising things about cinily.net. I decided to give them a chance, hoping for a smoother, more reliable process.</p>
<p>And I'm so glad I did! My experience was exactly what I was hoping for. I even saw a review that perfectly sums up my feelings: "The lens are adorable I get so many compliments I love my glasses. Great value. Perfect fit!" ✨</p>
<p>From start to finish, cinily.net was a breath of fresh air. The website was incredibly easy to navigate, with no frustrating glitches. My order processed smoothly, and I had no trouble applying the discount I wanted. The quality of my new glasses is fantastic – the fit is perfect, and the lenses are crystal clear. It's truly amazing to find such <a href="https://www.cinily.net/collections/eyes-frame?page=123">affordable prescription glasses</a> without compromising on quality or service. Customer service was also responsive and helpful when I had a small query. I finally found an online store that delivers on its promises! 😃</p>
